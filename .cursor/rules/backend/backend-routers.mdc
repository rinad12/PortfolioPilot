# FastAPI Router Standards

## Responsibility
- **Routing Only**: The router's ONLY job is to:
  1. Receive the request (parse body/params).
  2. Call a Service layer function.
  3. Return the response.
- **No Business Logic**: logic loops, complex calculations, or direct database queries (ORM calls) strictly belong in `services/`, NOT here.

## Endpoint Structure
- **Status Codes**: Explicitly define `status_code` in the decorator.
  - `POST` -> `201`
  - `GET` -> `200`
  - `DELETE` -> `204`
- **Response Model**: Always use `response_model` to filter data automatically.
  - Example: `@router.get("/", response_model=List[UserPublic])`

## Documentation
- **Docstrings**: Every endpoint must have a docstring explaining what it does.
- **Summary**: Use a short summary in the decorator if the function name isn't descriptive enough.
